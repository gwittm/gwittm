**💜Welcome to my profile!**
I´m 35 years old and I live near Munich in Zorneding. I´m married and we are lucky to have two great little girls 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧
The last few years I basicly was a mother and houswife but now as the girls grew bigger, I´m looking forward 
to start working again 💻. 
At my last job I acted as an interface between customers and our Web developers. So I
had the chance to get some insights of how web developers work and what they can create with "only a few commands" which
is of course much more than that. 
And i was really impressed 😍
With the course of neuefische, I hope to be able to do such great things as well in the near future. 
You are very welcome to track my learning-process here at github!
