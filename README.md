#  Welcome to my profileðŸ‘‹
**My name is Gabi**, 
IÂ´m 35 years old and I live near Munich in Zorneding. IÂ´m married and we are lucky to have two great little girls.
The last few years I basicly was a mother and houswife but now as the girls grew bigger, IÂ´m looking forward 
to start working again. 
At my last job I acted as an interface between customers and our Web developers. So I
had the chance to get some insights of how web developers work and what they can create with "only a few commands" which
is of course more then that. 
And i was really impressed!
With the course of neuefische, I hope to be able to do such great things as well in the near future. 
You are very welcome to track my learning-process here at github!
