#  Welcome to my profile!
**My name is Gabi**, 
I´m 35 years old and I live near Munich in Zorneding. I´m married and we are lucky to have two great little girls.
The last few years I basicly was a mother and houswife but now as the girls grew bigger, I´m looking forward 
to start working again. 
At my last job I acted as an interface between customers and our Web developers. So I
had the chance to get some insights of how the work and what they can create with "only a few commands". And i was
really impressed!
With the course of neuefische, I hope to be able to to such great things as well in the near future. 
You are very welcome to track my learning-process here at github!

How do I spend my day:
- Playing with my children
- doing the household
- joining the neuefische-lessons
- partying - but not in the common way... I´m doing Tupperware-Parties!
